AccuInfo
========

This code used to generate two faces, AccuInfo and AccuWhite, with different
UUID's. With SDK 2.0 we can now have configuration pages on the phone so I have
combined them.

There is no more AccuWhite. Instead, use AccuInfo and set a white background
from the configuration page in the Pebble app. The AccuWhite UUID is deprecated.
